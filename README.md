# AoC2022

[Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022) in
[BQN](https://mlochbaum.github.io/BQN/index.html) and maybe
[Racket](https://racket-lang.org/).

Go into `dayXX` directory, put input into `dayXX.txt` and then run either

```sh
$ racket dayXX.rkt
```

or

```sh
$ bqn dayXX.bqn
```

to get output.
